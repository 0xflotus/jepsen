This is a brief overview of the basic steps necessary to run jepsen on a set of machines/vms/containers:

1) You'll need 6 'machines' running ubuntu. 5 to run the server software, and 1 client machine.
2) You'll need java and maven installed
3) you'll need to install leiningen. To fetch out all the clojure and java dependencies just run 'lein deps'
4) You'll need to have ssh access to the 5 server machines
4a) You'll want passwordless key-based access, which means you'll need to setup ssh-agent and add an identity
5) The account will need to be able to sudo on the 5 server machines
6) The machines need to be resolvable via DNS or /etc/hosts

Those are all the configuration and setup issues I've run into so far running this. I've been just invoking the
jepsen targets directly via leiningen (e.g. lein run nuodb -n ....)
