# Tutorial

This tutorial will walk you through writing a Jepsen test from scratch. It is
also the basis for a paid [class](https://jepsen.io/training) offered by Jepsen
training.

If you aren't familiar with the Clojure language, we recommend you start with
[Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com/), [Clojure From
the Ground Up](https://aphyr.com/posts/301-clojure-from-the-ground-up-welcome),
or any guide that works for you.
