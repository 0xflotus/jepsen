# Jepsen Dgraph Tests

A test suite for the Dgraph distributed graph database.

## Usage

`lein test` runs tests; use `lein test --help` for details. For instance:

```
lein run test --local-binary ~/tmp/dgraph --nemesis none --rebalance-interval 10h --sequencing server --upsert-schema --time-limit 600 --concurrency 1n --workload bank --retry-db-setup --test-count 20
```

... tests a local binary in ~/tmp/dgraph, with network partitions, automatically rebalancing every 10 hours, using server-side sequencing, @upsert schema directives, with tests lasting 600 seconds, one client per node, performing the `bank` test workload, working around database join issues in dgraph, and for 20 tests, or until one test fails.

Use `lein run test-all` to run a full test suite. Test-all takes many of the
same arguments as `test`, but cycles through all combinations of workload,
nemesis, sequencing, and upserts.

To run it with Jaeger trace collection:

```sh
lein run test --local-binary /gobin/dgraph --force-download --nemesis partition-ring --workload bank --rebalance-interval 10h --upsert-schema --time-limit 600 --concurrency 30 --nodes "n1, n2, n3" --replicas 3 --test-count 20 --dgraph-jaeger-collector http://jaeger:14268 --dgraph-jaeger-agent http://jaeger:6831
```

This runs a Dgraph binary at /gobin/dgraph with Jaeger running on a `jaeger` host.
